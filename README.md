# Getting Started with Mega Menu Nav made for React apps

This is a personal project but free to use, feel free to make it better !
It is hard to find a proper Mega Menu for React apps. So I have decided to follow some css/html tutorial & refactor the code to make it react friendly.
You need styled-components for it to work.

I am also using a powerful CSS reset code from https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/, I would advise you to do the same.

## Usage

In the repository directory, you can see a normal React App project structure.
To use the Nav simply copy/paste from src/components the navigation folder to your own components folder.

<!-- Note -->

GlobalStyles.js has some styling for the navbar, please either use and refactor it to your needs, or find a way to translate those styles with your styling engine. (Vanilla CSS, SCSS, MUI styled-components etc.. etc..)

Import the Nav component into your App.js (See my example code)

And you're all set!
